Project 6: King Robert's birthday tournament
 
Main Focus
 
Multi-agent reinforcement learning.
Problem Description
 
In the great hall of King's Landing, Robert Baratheon, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, 
decrees a yearly tournament in celebration of his birth. The rival lords of the realm are summoned to send forth 
their bravest knights, who shall face one another in deadly combat. The winner shall bring glory and riches to 
their house, but the defeated will meet a gruesome end, their names quickly fading into obscurity. By the com-
mand of young Prince Joffrey, each duel must end in death.
As a newly appointed lord of the realm, you must choose a knight to represent your house in the tournament. 
Each year, you will select a champion to face the warriors of House Frey. Choose wisely, for if your champion falls 
in battle, they are lost to you forever. However, if they return victorious, their strength will grow, and they will be 
a mightier force for the years to come.
The first year of the tournament brings a cruel decision. Both your house and House Frey have several knights to 
choose from. As long as either house can muster a champion fit for battle, they may continue to send warriors into 
the fray. But beware, for a lost knight cannot be sent again, and each defeat brings your house closer to ruin.
Challenging variant
 
In a twist of fate, Prince Joffrey soon grows bored of the bloodshed and loses interest in the tournament. Now, the 
duels no longer must end in death. A defeated champion may return to the roster. In this new era, champions who 
are wounded in battle — whether victorious or defeated — may incur minor injuries that keep them from fighting 
for a couple of years. Should your knight be so unfortunate, you must wait for their recovery or choose another 
champion for the next tournament. The uncertainty of fate looms larger than ever, and the balance of power may 
shift with every wound, victory, or defeat.
Tasks
 
Model the tournament as a 2v2 zero-sum game in which the two players (houses) have a set of actions (champ-
tions), each pair of chosen actions has a possibility of granting victory to either house.
Consider different learning procedures.
