In this space exploration game, the agent rolls a pool of dices to explore a tricky dungeon looking for treasures. 
Each roll result is associated with a different outcome in terms of the size of the treasury discovered but also in 
terms of the risks associated with exploration (e.g., being injuried, game over, loose part of the cumulated treasu-
res). At each game turn, the agent needs to take a decision between stopping exploration and come back home 
with the treasuries cumulated or push its luck, rolling the dices one more time.
Challenging variant
 
Taking risky decisions may be beneficial in terms of experience. The negative effects of certain dice roll outcomes 
could become slightly less severe as those outcomes occur more frequently. In other words, each time the agent 
experiences a certain result, that result changes and becomes a little less negative.
Tasks
 
Model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Implement a policy gradient-based RL agent (e.g., REINFORCE or Actor-Critic).
Investigate the effect of different reward structures and baseline techniques on learning efficiency.
Compare policy gradient-based learning with a value-based approach (e.g., Q-learning).

Main Focus
 
Continuous action spaces.
Problem Description
 
In this resource management game, the agent must allocate resources such as water, fertilizer, and labor to optimi-
ze crop growth while managing limited supplies in a farm. Each turn, the environment dynamically changes with 
fluctuating weather conditions, soil health variations, and shifting market prices, requiring the agent to adapt its 
strategy accordingly. Overwatering may lead to crop diseases, while under-fertilization slows growth and reduces 
yield, depending on the crops and the weather and soil conditions. At the end of each year, the farm production is 
sold and this represents the reward that the agent wants to maximize in the long-term (i.e., after a certain number 
of years in an episodic setting).
Challenging variant
 
The agent must also decide when to sell harvested crops, balancing immediate profits with the potential for better 
market prices in the future. The economic aspect introduces a layer of complexity, as reinvesting in farm improve-
ments or expanding crop diversity can lead to long-term success but requires careful financial planning. Additio-
nally, over-farming can degrade soil quality, making sustainability a key factor in optimizing long-term yield. 
Tasks
 
Model the environment with a continuous action space, requiring policy-based RL approaches.
Compare different exploration strategies.
