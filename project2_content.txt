In this space exploration game, the agent rolls a pool of dices to explore a tricky dungeon looking for treasures. 
Each roll result is associated with a different outcome in terms of the size of the treasury discovered but also in 
terms of the risks associated with exploration (e.g., being injuried, game over, loose part of the cumulated treasu-
res). At each game turn, the agent needs to take a decision between stopping exploration and come back home 
with the treasuries cumulated or push its luck, rolling the dices one more time.
Challenging variant
 
Taking risky decisions may be beneficial in terms of experience. The negative effects of certain dice roll outcomes 
could become slightly less severe as those outcomes occur more frequently. In other words, each time the agent 
experiences a certain result, that result changes and becomes a little less negative.
Tasks
 
Model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Implement a policy gradient-based RL agent (e.g., REINFORCE or Actor-Critic).
Investigate the effect of different reward structures and baseline techniques on learning efficiency.
Compare policy gradient-based learning with a value-based approach (e.g., Q-learning).
Project 5: Harvest and Thrive
 
Main Focus
 
Continuous action spaces.
Problem Description
 
In this resource management game, the agent must allocate resources such as water, fertilizer, and labor to optimi-
ze crop growth while managing limited supplies in a farm. Each turn, the environment dynamically changes with 
fluctuating weather conditions, soil health variations, and shifting market prices, requiring the agent to adapt its 
strategy accordingly. Overwatering may lead to crop diseases, while under-fertilization slows growth and reduces 
yield, depending on the crops and the weather and soil conditions. At the end of each year, the farm production is 
sold and this represents the reward that the agent wants to maximize in the long-term (i.e., after a certain number 
of years in an episodic setting).
Challenging variant
 
The agent must also decide when to sell harvested crops, balancing immediate profits with the potential for better 
market prices in the future. The economic aspect introduces a layer of complexity, as reinvesting in farm improve-
ments or expanding crop diversity can lead to long-term success but requires careful financial planning. Additio-
nally, over-farming can degrade soil quality, making sustainability a key factor in optimizing long-term yield. 
Tasks
 
Model the environment with a continuous action space, requiring policy-based RL approaches.
Compare different exploration strategies.
Evaluate how different action space constraints affect learning performance.
Project 6: King Robert's birthday tournament
 
Main Focus
 
Multi-agent reinforcement learning.
Problem Description
 
In the great hall of King's Landing, Robert Baratheon, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, 
decrees a yearly tournament in celebration of his birth. The rival lords of the realm are summoned to send forth 
their bravest knights, who shall face one another in deadly combat. The winner shall bring glory and riches to 
their house, but the defeated will meet a gruesome end, their names quickly fading into obscurity. By the com-
mand of young Prince Joffrey, each duel must end in death.
As a newly appointed lord of the realm, you must choose a knight to represent your house in the tournament. 
Each year, you will select a champion to face the warriors of House Frey. Choose wisely, for if your champion falls 
in battle, they are lost to you forever. However, if they return victorious, their strength will grow, and they will be 
a mightier force for the years to come.
The first year of the tournament brings a cruel decision. Both your house and House Frey have several knights to 
choose from. As long as either house can muster a champion fit for battle, they may continue to send warriors into 
the fray. But beware, for a lost knight cannot be sent again, and each defeat brings your house closer to ruin.
Challenging variant
 
In a twist of fate, Prince Joffrey soon grows bored of the bloodshed and loses interest in the tournament. Now, the 
duels no longer must end in death. A defeated champion may return to the roster. In this new era, champions who 
are wounded in battle — whether victorious or defeated — may incur minor injuries that keep them from fighting 
for a couple of years. Should your knight be so unfortunate, you must wait for their recovery or choose another 
champion for the next tournament. The uncertainty of fate looms larger than ever, and the balance of power may 
shift with every wound, victory, or defeat.
Tasks
 
Model the tournament as a 2v2 zero-sum game in which the two players (houses) have a set of actions (champ-
tions), each pair of chosen actions has a possibility of granting victory to either house.
Consider different learning procedures.
