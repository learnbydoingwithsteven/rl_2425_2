## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### Environment Specifications

**State Space:**
- Player sum: 4-31 (continuous range)
- Dealer card: 1-10 (Ace to 10/Face)
- Usable ace: Boolean (0 or 1)
- Peek info: 0-10 (if cheating enabled)

**Action Space:**
- 0: Stand (stop drawing cards)
- 1: Hit (draw another card)
- 2: Peek (cheating variant only)

**Reward Structure:**
- Win: +1
- Loss: -1
- Draw: 0
- Caught cheating: -10 (configurable)

### Feature Extraction

#### Binary Features (55 dimensions)
```python
- Player sum one-hot: [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]  # 32 features
- Dealer card one-hot: [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]  # 10 features
- Usable ace one-hot: [0, 1] or [1, 0]         # 2 features
- Peek info one-hot: [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]    # 11 features
```

#### Polynomial Features (15 dimensions)
```python
Base: [1, player_norm, dealer_norm, ace_norm, peek_norm]
Polynomial (degree 2): All combinations of base features
Total: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 features
```

### Learning Algorithm

**Semi-Gradient SARSA:**
```
Q(s,a) = w_a^T φ(s)

Update rule:
w_a ← w_a + α[r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)]φ(s)

where:
- α = 0.01 (learning rate)
- γ = 0.99 (discount factor)
- ε = 0.1 → 0.01 (epsilon-greedy exploration with decay)
```
