Project Descriptions
 
The final project consists in the implementation of a RL solution to a simple problem. Students have to provide 
access to a GitHub repository containing the code and reproducible results. Finally, the project will be discussed 
after a 10 minutes presentation in English with slides. The project discussion will be set by appointment, accor-
ding to the following procedure:
1. Subscribe one of the official exam dates
2. Submit the link to your GitHub repository as soon as the project is ready
3. Contact Prof. Ferrara and set and appointment for the discussion
4. The appointment for the exam part on theory should be taken directly with Prof. Cesa-Bianchi
The project is an individual work.
All the projects are presented in a simplified version. There are no constraints on the technology. You can use the 
gymnasium environment or any other framework for modeling environments and agents.
Focus of the project is to evaluate the student understanding of the problems and the exam will include que-
stions about theory starting from the proposed project.
Generally speaking, the project proposals are just ideas that can be modified or just taken as suggestions for de-
veloping your own objectives.
Try to have fun!
